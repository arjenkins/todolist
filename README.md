# ToDolist
This is a user friendly to-do list that is comprised of Java, Spring MVC, Maven, creates private user sessions and stores data w/MySQL.

I was inspired to create this ToDo list to assist with better planning and organization skills by allowing one to clearly map out goals and tasks. I am including quotes because most people feel motivated after reading positive material. It is my hope that this added resolve will assist the mind to stay focused, and leave a desire to re-visit this web application, which again helps to remind the user of their pending tasks. 

## Upcoming Features
- A message system via email to alert the user when they are less than a week away from their task completion date.
- A custom created API that displays randomized positive, motivating, and inspirational quotes.
